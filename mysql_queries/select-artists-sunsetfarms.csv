Along with pet donkeys, horses, and a llama, Sandy and her daughter Christy, a veterinarian, love the shepherds life. A sheep farm of over 300 acres, owned and leased, she raises her flock of sheep naturally, on the native grasses of the Gulf Islands.</p>
<p>Naturally raised sheep are happy sheep, which produce wonderful wool for knitting, spinning, and felting, beautiful sheepskins, all natural wool comforters, blankets and pillows, and the best natural lamb meat on the Gulf Islands fit for a Queen. In fact, it was our farm that provided lamb for Queen Elizabeth's visit to Victoria in the 1980's.</p>","11 - 4","By Appt.","11 - 4","11 - 4","11 - 4","11 - 4","By Appt.",48.924755,-123.584690,y,y,n,n,y,11-4,11-4,11-4,11-4,11-4,11-4,"at the market","11 - 4",closed,"11 - 4","11 - 4","11 - 4","11 - 4","11 - 4","10 - 3","10 - 3","10 - 3","10 - 3","10 - 3","10 - 3","at the market"
